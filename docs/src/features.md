# Features

## Deployment Tracking

At the core, DeployBoard is a simple deployment tracking tool. Simply send DeployBoard an event, and it will log that event.

## Analytics

Because DeployBoard tracks all of your events, it is able to provide valuable analytics around the velocity of your team. See DORA metrics for more information.

## Compliance/Audit Log

The append-only hashing nature of DeployBoard allows you to confidently hand over deployment events to auditors.

## Notifications

Replace the manual notifications with automated messaging. No longer will you have to post updates when deployments are starting or when they are finished. No one will question if a deployment is still in progress.

## Self-Service Ops

You no longer have to reach our to your Dev or Ops team to find out what version of an application is deployed, simply check the dashboard.

Answers common questions:

* "What version of <app> is deployed to <env>?"
* "When was <app> deployed to <env>?"
* "What applications were deployed around <time>?"
